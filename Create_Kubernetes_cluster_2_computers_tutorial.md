# Creating a kubernetes cluster with 2 computers

## Introduciton

My goal is to create a kubernetes cluster with two nodes: a control plane (master node) and a worker node using my two linux machines. I followed the instructions from https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/. https://github.com/NotHarshhaa/Kubernetes and https://devopscube.com/setup-kubernetes-cluster-kubeadm/ are also a couple of good references. However, I ran into a few small issues, some were just because I missed some details since I didn't have much experience with Kubernetes.
