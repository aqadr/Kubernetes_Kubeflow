# Creating a kubernetes cluster with 2 computers

## Introduciton

The following is a github co-pilot generated paragraph

```
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a highly flexible and scalable infrastructure for running and managing containerized workloads across multiple hosts. With Kubernetes, you can easily deploy, scale, and manage applications in a distributed environment, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.

```

My goal is to create a kubernetes cluster with two nodes: a control plane (master node) and a worker node using my two linux machines. I followed the instructions from `https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/`. `https://github.com/NotHarshhaa/Kubernetes` and `https://devopscube.com/setup-kubernetes-cluster-kubeadm/` are also good references. However, I ran into a few small issues, some were just because I missed some details since I didn't have much experience with Kubernetes.
